my first github repository 4th feb 2018

I'm interested in building an automated crypto trading robot. Basically this will use any inputs available to it to identify high probability trade setups. No one can see the future but there is a good probability that many will do the same thing when price action dictates a high probability trade. Their action can move prices and trigger other traders to enter market orders which leads to a snow-ball effect. A self fulfiling prophecy so to speak which can lead to an overbought condition which is basically a mistake waiting to be corrected with a correction. A bot can trade faster than a human 247.
